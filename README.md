echo "# AI-Powered Resume Ranker"
echo ""
echo "## Project Overview"
echo ""
echo "The AI-Powered Resume Ranker is a Streamlit web application designed to help recruiters and hiring managers efficiently identify the most relevant candidates for a given job description. It leverages fundamental Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, specifically TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and Cosine Similarity, to quantify the textual similarity between a job description and multiple resume PDFs."
echo ""
echo "This project demonstrates an end-to-end AI/ML application, from text preprocessing and feature extraction to similarity calculation and interactive visualization, all within a user-friendly Python-based web interface."
echo ""
echo "## Features"
echo ""
echo "* **PDF Resume Upload:** Directly upload multiple resume PDF files. The application automatically extracts text from the PDFs for analysis."
echo ""
echo "* **Job Description Input:** Paste or load a sample job description to serve as the target for ranking."
echo ""
echo "* **TF-IDF & Cosine Similarity:** Employs industry-standard NLP algorithms to create numerical representations of text and calculate their semantic closeness."
echo ""
echo "* **Ranked Results:** Displays uploaded resumes sorted by their relevance score (percentage match) to the job description, from highest to lowest."
echo ""
echo "* **Interactive UI:** Built with Streamlit for a simple and intuitive web-based user experience."
echo ""
echo "* **Sample Data:** Includes a sample job description for quick testing and demonstration."
echo ""
echo "* **Responsive Design:** Adapts to different screen sizes, providing a good experience on various devices."
echo ""
echo "## How it Works"
echo ""
echo "1. **Job Description Input:** You provide the job description text. This acts as the query document."
echo ""
echo "2. **Resume Uploads:** You upload one or more resume PDFs."
echo ""
echo "3. **Text Extraction:** For each uploaded PDF, the application uses \`PyPDF2\` to extract all readable text content."
echo ""
echo "4. **Text Preprocessing:** Both the job description and the extracted resume texts undergo a basic preprocessing step:"
echo ""
echo "   * Conversion to lowercase."
echo ""
echo "   * Removal of non-alphanumeric characters."
echo ""
echo "   * Tokenization (splitting text into individual words)."
echo ""
echo "5. **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) Calculation:**"
echo ""
echo "   * **Term Frequency (TF):** Measures how frequently a term appears in a document."
echo ""
echo "   * **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF):** Measures how important a term is across the entire collection of documents (job description + all resumes). Common words (like \"the\", \"a\") get lower IDF, while unique, domain-specific terms get higher IDF."
echo ""
echo "   * TF-IDF combines these two, giving a weight to each word, reflecting its importance in a specific document relative to the entire corpus."
echo ""
echo "6. **Vector Representation:** Each document (job description and resumes) is transformed into a numerical vector based on its TF-IDF scores for all words in the vocabulary."
echo ""
echo "7. **Cosine Similarity:** The cosine similarity is calculated between the job description's TF-IDF vector and each resume's TF-IDF vector. This metric measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors, ranging from 0 (no similarity) to 1 (perfect similarity)."
echo ""
echo "8. **Ranking:** Resumes are then ranked and displayed based on their cosine similarity score, with higher scores indicating a better match."
echo ""
echo "## Technologies Used"
echo ""
echo "* **Python 3.11** (Recommended for compatibility)"
echo ""
echo "* **Streamlit:** For building the interactive web application."
echo ""
echo "* **PyPDF2:** For extracting text from PDF documents."
echo ""
echo "* **NumPy:** Essential for numerical operations and vector calculations."
echo ""
echo "* **Standard Python Libraries:** \`math\`, \`collections\`, \`io\`."
echo ""
echo "## Setup and Installation (Local)"
echo ""
echo "Follow these steps to get the application running on your local machine:"
echo ""
echo "1. **Ensure Python 3.11 is Installed:**"
echo ""
echo "   * **Important:** Using Python 3.11 is highly recommended to avoid common dependency conflicts with \`numpy\` and other packages on Windows. If you have Python 3.12/3.13 and encounter installation issues, consider uninstalling it and installing 3.11."
echo ""
echo "   * Download Python 3.11.x from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)."
echo ""
echo "   * During installation, **make sure to check the box \"Add Python 3.11 to PATH\"**."
echo ""
echo "2. **Disable Python App Execution Aliases (Windows Specific):**"
echo ""
echo "   * Go to Windows \`Settings\` > \`Apps\` > \`App execution aliases\`."
echo ""
echo "   * Turn \`Off\` the aliases for \`python.exe\` and \`python3.exe\`."
echo ""
echo "   * Close all terminal windows after doing this."
echo ""
echo "3. **Create Project Directory & Files:**"
echo ""
echo "   * Create a new folder (e.g., \`Resume_Ranker\`) on your system."
echo ""
echo "   * Save the \`resume_ranker_app.py\` file inside this folder."
echo ""
echo "   * Create a file named \`requirements.txt\` inside the same folder and add the following content:"
echo ""
echo "     \`\`\`"
echo "     streamlit==1.33.0"
echo "     PyPDF2==3.0.1"
echo "     numpy==1.22.4"
echo "     "
echo "     \`\`\`"
echo ""
echo "4. **Open Terminal/PowerShell and Navigate:**"
echo ""
echo "   * Open a new Terminal or PowerShell window."
echo ""
echo "   * Navigate to your project directory:"
echo ""
echo "     \`\`\`"
echo "     cd D:\\Resume_Ranker"
echo "     "
echo "     \`\`\`"
echo ""
echo "     (Replace \`D:\\Resume_Ranker\` with your actual path)"
echo ""
echo "5. **Create a Virtual Environment:**"
echo ""
echo "   * It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies."
echo ""
echo "     \`\`\`"
echo "     python -m venv venv"
echo "     "
echo "     \`\`\`"
echo ""
echo "6. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**"
echo ""
echo "   * **On Windows (PowerShell):**"
echo ""
echo "     \`\`\`"
echo "     .\\venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1"
echo "     "
echo "     \`\`\`"
echo ""
echo "   * **On Windows (Command Prompt/CMD):**"
echo ""
echo "     \`\`\`"
echo "     venv\\Scripts\\activate.bat"
echo "     "
echo "     \`\`\`"
echo ""
echo "   * Your terminal prompt will change to show \`(venv)\` at the beginning, indicating the environment is active."
echo ""
echo "7. **Install Dependencies:**"
echo ""
echo "   * With the virtual environment activated, install the required libraries:"
echo ""
echo "     \`\`\`"
echo "     pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt"
echo "     "
echo "     \`\`\`"
echo ""
echo "     This step might take a few moments. Ensure there are no major errors."
echo ""
echo "8. **Run the Streamlit Application:**"
echo ""
echo "   * Once the installation is complete, run the application:"
echo ""
echo "     \`\`\`"
echo "     python -m streamlit run resume_ranker_app.py"
echo "     "
echo "     \`\`\`"
echo ""
echo "   * This command will open a new tab in your default web browser, displaying the AI-Powered Resume Ranker app."
